# dnd-1
 Richard Garriott's 1977 DND#1 via a PDP-11
 
 I'm trying to run DND#1 written in  BASIC by  Richard Garriott in 1977 on my PDP-11 clone without much luck.
 I have been able to partially port it to BBC BASIC on my Z80 system as I have been unable to determine what version of BASIC the original software was running on. 
 Any suggestions about how I should proceed would be welcome?
 
STILL TO DO ON MY CURRENT BBC PORT - FILE I/O (CURRENTLY EMBEDDING THE EXTERNAL DATA IN PORTED CODE)
